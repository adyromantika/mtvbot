# mytvbot

This is a working bot to control my LG TV. Anyone can use it just by creating a bot and setting these environment variables:

1. `TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN`
1. `RESTRICTED_CHAT_ID`
1. `TV_IP_ADDRESS`

The bot must be able to connect to `TV_IP_ADDRESS`. You might want to port forward. I use a Raspberry Pi.
